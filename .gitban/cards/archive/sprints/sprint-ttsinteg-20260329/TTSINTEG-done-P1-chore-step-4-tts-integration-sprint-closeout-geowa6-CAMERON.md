# TTS Integration Sprint Closeout

## Task Overview

* **Task Description:** Close out the TTSINTEG sprint — archive completed cards, generate sprint summary, update changelog with version bump, mark roadmap milestone complete, and capture retrospective notes.
* **Motivation:** Sprint closeout ensures work is archived, discoverable, and reflected in the project's changelog and roadmap. Deferred from the kickoff card (ia8id8) to maintain a single time-horizon per card.
* **Scope:** Gitban operations only — archive_cards(), generate_archive_summary(), update_changelog(), upsert_roadmap(). No code changes.
* **Related Work:** Sprint kickoff card ia8id8. Depends on all 4 work cards being done: 7g52mr, 3c490l, s81ofk, p7hchj.
* **Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes

**Required Checks:**
* [x] **Task description** clearly states what needs to be done.
* [x] **Motivation** explains why this work is necessary.
* [x] **Scope** defines what will be changed.
