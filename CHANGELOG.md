## v2.21.0 (2026-04-20)

### Added
- **Platform-native TTS backends** — `tts.enabled: true` now produces real speech on every supported platform. macOS uses `say`, Linux uses a `piper` -> `espeak-ng` priority chain, and Windows uses SAPI5 via `System.Speech.Synthesis`. Previously, enabling TTS wrote a cue line but produced no audible output outside the mocked test harness.
- **`--list-voices` / `-ListVoices`** — `scripts/tts-native.sh --list-voices` and `scripts/tts-native.ps1 -ListVoices` enumerate installed voices per platform (macOS `say -v ?`, espeak-ng, piper model dir, SAPI5 `GetInstalledVoices`), making voice discovery self-serve.
- **SAPI5 spaced-voice-name support** — quoted `-Voice "Microsoft David Desktop"` and similar spaced names survive the bash -> `powershell.exe -File` handoff and resolve case-insensitively against installed voices.

### Changed
- **awk hardening in `scripts/tts-native.sh`** — rate, volume, and model-path derivations use `awk -v` variable binding instead of string interpolation so hostile config values cannot inject `awk` code into the engine-argument pipeline.

### Fixed
- **`peon` CLI shims prefer `pwsh` with fallback to `powershell`** — when PS 7 is installed alongside PS 5.1, PSModulePath can end up with PS 7 module dirs in front of the 5.1 inbox paths, causing 5.1 to load PS 7's incompatible `Microsoft.PowerShell.Security` module. Both `peon.cmd` and the bash `peon` wrapper now probe for `pwsh` first and fall back to `powershell.exe` only if absent. 5.1-only users see identical behavior.

## v2.20.0 (2026-04-14)

### Added
- **Rich native macOS notifications** — `terminal-notifier` and osascript fallback now include a subtitle (CESP category) and group notifications by session so they replace each other in Notification Center instead of piling up. Uses `PEON_SESSION_ID` as the group key. PR #466.
- **`peon packs rotation add --install`** — add one or more packs to rotation AND download them from the registry in one command. Works with the flag before or after the pack names. PR #468.

### Changed
- **Security hardening**: migrated inline `'$SHELL_VAR'` interpolation in `python3 -c "..."` blocks throughout `peon.sh` to `os.environ.get()` pattern. Prevents quote-injection on config values with special characters; no behavior change for normal usage. PR #469.
- **Homebrew formula simplified**: delegates pack downloads in `peon-ping-setup` to the shared `pack-download.sh` engine rather than duplicating download/fallback logic in the Ruby formula. PR #15 (homebrew-tap).

### Docs
- **`peon setup` wizard guide added to README** — quickstart example, screenshots of the wizard flow, and a pointer back to per-setting `peon` subcommands for advanced users. PR #467.

## v2.19.0 (2026-04-14)

### Added
- **`peon setup` interactive wizard** — guided first-time setup covering volume, category toggles, desktop notifications, overlay theme, position, and auto-dismiss timing. PR #465, closes #283.
- **Session-based notification stacking** — notifications from the same Claude session now stack into a single overlay with a count badge (`(3) project — needs approval`). Auto-dismisses when the user resumes interaction (UserPromptSubmit, Stop, PreToolUse, etc.). New config: `notification_stacking` (default `true`). PR #463, addresses #340.
- **Visible X close button on overlays** — `glass`, `sakura`, and `jarvis` themes now show a discoverable `×` in the top-right. New config: `notification_close_button` (default `true`). PR #464.
- **`notification_title_marker` config** — customize or disable the `●` shown before project names in notification titles and terminal tabs. Set to `""` to disable, or `"🔔"` to customize. PR #457.
- **Expanded `peon status`** — structured sections (core, packs, categories, notifications, audio routing, behavior timings, trainer, TTS, debug, IDEs), resolved active pack display with path-rule reasoning, Linux player detection, relay status for SSH/devcontainer. PR #461.

### Fixed
- **NSPanel overlays no longer steal focus** — switched `glass`, `sakura`, `jarvis` themes to `NSPanel` with `NSWindowStyleMaskNonactivatingPanel` so clicking a notification doesn't dismiss iTerm2 hotkey/overlay windows. PR #462.
- **Correct overlay labels for red/yellow notifications** — color-based fallback no longer mislabels permission requests as "LIMIT REACHED". Red → "APPROVAL NEEDED", yellow → "STANDING BY". Disabled categories now suppress both sound AND the overlay. PR #460.
- **Pack sync robustness** — `pack-download.sh` now skips already-installed packs via on-disk checksum verification, probes the manifest URL before creating local directories, shows per-pack status (✓/✅/⚠️/❌), and includes a summary with counts and disk usage. Fixes a bug where filenames with spaces (e.g. `incoming (1).mp3`) re-downloaded every run due to incorrect checksum parsing. PR #453.
- **Linux `notify-send` respects `notification_dismiss_seconds`** — previously hardcoded to 5000ms, now uses the configured value. PR #455.
- **Nix home-manager zsh module** — updated `programs.zsh.initExtra` to `programs.zsh.initContent` for the current home-manager API. PR #456.

### Docs
- **Updated Warcraft III Orc peon mapping examples** in README (EN/zh/ja) to correctly reflect which voice lines belong to which CESP category. Closes #333.

## v2.18.0 (2026-04-11)

### Added
- **`--lang` flag for pack filtering** — filter sound packs by language during install and registry listing. Supports prefix matching (`--lang en` matches `en`, `en-GB`) and multi-language packs. Works with `install.sh`, `peon packs install`, and `peon packs list --registry`. PR #450, closes #395.

### Fixed
- **Sounds now play in delegate/autonomous mode** — sessions using `delegate` or `dangerouslySkipPermissions` permission mode (Conductor, Claude Desktop, etc.) are no longer silenced. Set `suppress_delegate_sessions: true` in config to restore old behavior. Also adds sound to `idle_prompt` notifications (maps to `task.complete`). Fixes #452.
- **WSL audio playback** — replaced `SoundPlayer` + `setsid` with `MediaPlayer` (PresentationCore) for WSL. Handles WAV/MP3 natively with volume control, no ffmpeg dependency. Fixes #446.
- **Windows MediaPlayer for MP3/WMA** — `win-play.ps1` now uses native `MediaPlayer` for `.mp3` and `.wma` files (not just `.wav`). No more silent failure when CLI players aren't installed. Fixes #451.
- **macOS osascript process accumulation** — overlay notification processes are now cleaned up proactively on each invocation (kills stale processes >30s old) and watchdog subshells are explicitly terminated after overlay exits. Prevents CPU-consuming buildup in long sessions. Fixes #449.
- **Windows git-bash stdin hang** — bounded stdin read to 2 seconds to prevent `cat` from blocking until the outer timeout fires. Fixes #445.

## v2.17.3 (2026-03-31)

### Fixed
- **_peon_log: command not found on peon preview** — added a no-op stub for `_peon_log` before `play_sound` is called. The function was only defined inside the main Python block but called unconditionally by `play_sound`, causing `peon preview` and `peon play` to emit a shell error. Fixes #421.


## v2.17.2 (2026-03-29)

### Fixed
- **WezTerm click-to-focus** — added WezTerm bundle ID (`com.github.wez.wezterm`) to `_mac_terminal_bundle_id()` so click-to-focus works in `standard` notification mode on macOS. Fixes #417.

## v2.17.1 (2026-03-29)

### Fixed
- **Hook stderr leak on /dev/tty** — wrapped all tty write sites in brace groups so bash's own redirect-open failure is suppressed by `2>/dev/null`. Previously, Claude Code (and any tool that inspects hook stderr) would see a spurious error on every session start when `/dev/tty` is unavailable (WSL2, headless). Fixes #407.
- **Spurious update notice** — added same-version guard on update notice display; stale `.update_available` files from previous installs are cleaned up silently instead of showing "2.17.0 → 2.17.0".
- **Themed overlay position** — glass, jarvis, and sakura themed overlays now respect `notification_position` config (was always defaulting to top-right). Brought to parity with default `mac-overlay.js`. Fixed by #413.

## v2.17.0 (2026-03-26)

### Added
- **Structured debug logging** — 9-phase decision tracing for hook execution (`peon debug on/off`, `peon logs`). Traces event routing, config loading, state management, pack selection, sound pick, playback, notification, trainer, and exit timing in a structured JSONL-like format.
- **`peon debug` CLI command** — toggle debug logging on/off with `peon debug on` and `peon debug off`. Check current state with `peon debug`.
- **`peon logs` CLI command** — view recent debug logs with `peon logs`, `peon logs --last N`, `peon logs --session`, and `peon logs --clear`. Daily log rotation with configurable retention.
- **`PEON_DEBUG=1` env var override** — enable debug logging for a single hook invocation without changing config.
- **`debug` and `debug_retention_days` config keys** — persistent debug toggle (default: `false`) and log retention period (default: 7 days).
- **Cross-platform debug parity** — identical structured log format on Unix (`peon.sh`) and Windows (`peon.ps1`).
- **Shared test fixtures** — BATS and Pester tests share fixture data enforcing format parity between platforms.
- **`peon status` verbose output** — now includes debug logging state.
- **Nix/Home Manager: custom pack sources** — `installPacks` now accepts both simple strings (for og-packs) and attribute sets with `name` and `src` fields to install packs from any source. The `src` field accepts any Nix fetcher result (e.g., `pkgs.fetchFromGitHub`), enabling community packs from the [openpeon.com registry](https://openpeon.com/) that aren't in og-packs while maintaining full reproducibility.

### Fixed
- **State contention test** — removed `|| true` that was silently masking assertion failures in concurrent state access tests.
- **Bash log helpers** — real millisecond timestamps and proper newline escaping in structured log output.
- **Missing exit/route logs** — added `[route]` and `[exit]` log entries to all early-exit paths for complete tracing.

## v2.16.1 (2026-03-20)

### Fixed
- **macOS persistent overlay (`dismiss=0`) killed by watchdog** — the shell-level safety watchdog in `notify.sh` computed `_max_wait = 0 + 5 = 5s`, killing the JXA overlay process 5 seconds after spawn even when the user had configured persistent notifications via `peon notifications dismiss 0`. Persistent mode now sets `_max_wait=86400` (24 h) so the overlay stays until clicked. (#344)
- **Linux `urgency=critical` overrides dismiss time** — `notify-send --urgency=critical` (used for red/error sounds) caused notification daemons like `dunst` and `mako` to ignore `--expire-time`, pinning the notification until manually dismissed regardless of `notification_dismiss_seconds`. Changed to always use `urgency=normal`; error sounds are already visually distinct via title/color. (#378)

## v2.16.0 (2026-03-20)

### Added
- **Windows WAV volume control** — replaced `SoundPlayer` (which ignores volume) with `MediaPlayer` (WPF/PresentationCore) in `win-play.ps1`. Volume is now respected for WAV playback on Windows. Uses `MediaOpened`/`MediaFailed` event subscription with dispatcher pump for reliable playback duration tracking. (#381)

### Fixed
- **RovoDev hook installer: multi-line YAML command values** — installer now correctly handles `- command:` entries whose values span multiple YAML continuation lines (e.g., multi-line `osascript` strings). The new hook entry is inserted after the full continuation block, preventing corruption of existing config. (#384)

## v2.15.2 (2026-03-15)

### Fixed
- **Shell quoting safety in peon.sh** — audited all 61 `python3 -c` invocations and fixed 3 hazardous patterns (7 occurrences) where escaped double quotes inside bash double-quoted strings could cause silent failures. Dict access and method args now use single-quoted Python strings extracted to temp variables.
- **Windows atomic state I/O hardening** — `Write-StateAtomic` now uses `Move-Item -Force` for truly atomic overwrites on PowerShell 7+, eliminating a sub-millisecond race window. `Read-StateWithRetry` cleans up orphaned `.tmp` files left by safety timer exits.
- **Windows ffplay install guidance** — post-install tip now recommends `choco install ffmpeg` (adds ffplay to PATH automatically), warns about `winget install ffmpeg` Gyan build PATH issues, and provides manual fallback instructions.
- **Windows CLI bind/unbind quality** — added `Get-ActivePack` helper for cross-platform parity with `peon.sh`, restored runtime `path_rules` matching engine, and added `--status` path_rules display. bind `--install` now shows download progress instead of running silently.

## v2.15.1 (2026-03-09)

### Fixed
- **Overlay themes show wrong status labels** — themed overlays (jarvis, glass, sakura) derived their banner label from notification color alone, causing mismatches: Stop events showed "INPUT REQUIRED", PermissionRequest showed "LIMIT REACHED", and idle prompts showed "LIMIT REACHED". Added a `NOTIFY_TYPE` semantic variable (`complete`/`permission`/`limit`/`idle`/`question`) that flows from `peon.sh` → `notify.sh` → overlay scripts as `argv[10]`, with color-based fallback preserved for relay.sh callers. Closes #342.

# Changelog

## v2.15.0 (2026-03-06)

### Added
- **`peon packs rotation clear`** — new subcommand to zero out the pack rotation in a single command. Sets `pack_rotation` to `[]` in config.json and syncs adapter configs. Closes #321.

### Fixed
- **`/peon-ping-rename` bleeds across tabs in same project** — names set in one terminal tab were appearing in all other tabs opened to the same project directory. Root cause: hooks run detached from the controlling terminal, so `tty` returned the same value across all tabs, collapsing the per-tab key. Switched to `$PPID` (Claude Code's process PID) as the stable tab identifier: different terminal tabs spawn separate Claude Code processes with different PIDs, while `/clear` within a tab reuses the same process. Composite key `ppid::cwd` replaces the previous `tty::cwd` key in `tty_names` state. Closes #325.


## v2.14.0 (2026-03-06)

### Added
- **Configurable SSH audio routing** (`peon ssh-audio [relay|auto|local]`) — choose how audio is routed in SSH sessions. `relay` (default) preserves existing behavior; `auto` tries relay then falls back to local playback on the SSH host; `local` always plays on the SSH host. Closes #206.

### Fixed
- **Nix/Home Manager: cursor adapter lookup** — `adapters/cursor.sh` now resolves `peon.sh` via a priority chain (`PEON_DIR` → `CLAUDE_PEON_DIR` → `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/hooks/peon-ping` → `$HOME/.openpeon`) instead of hardcoding `~/.claude`. Fixes Cursor in Nix installs.
- **Nix/Home Manager: reproducible pack installation** — sound packs now installed directly from the `og-packs` repo at a pinned version instead of a non-reproducible activation script.
- **Nix/Home Manager: hook setup documentation** — README now shows how to wire up IDE hooks manually in the Nix context; the HM module no longer attempts to manage hook files to avoid config conflicts. Closes #302.

## v2.13.1 (2026-03-05)

### Fixed
- **`/peon-ping-rename` title lost in plan mode** — when accepting a plan or entering plan mode, the session name would revert to the git repo/folder name. Early-exit paths (unknown events, unknown `Notification` types, `PostToolUseFailure` for non-Bash tools, `SubagentStart`, compact `SessionStart`) now emit `PROJECT`/`STATUS` so the shell still sets the tab title even when no sound plays.

## v2.13.0 (2026-03-03)

### Added
- **Rovo Dev CLI adapter** (`adapters/rovodev.sh`) — translates Rovo Dev event hooks (`on_complete`, `on_error`, `on_tool_permission`) into CESP categories for peon-ping sound playback. Argument-based (not stdin), matching Rovo Dev's shell command hook model.
- **Rovo Dev CLI auto-registration** — `install.sh` detects `~/.rovodev/config.yml` and automatically appends `eventHooks` configuration, so `peon-ping-setup` just works for Rovo Dev users.
- **`/peon-ping-rename` skill** — give the current Claude Code session a custom name shown in desktop notification titles and terminal tab title. Zero tokens consumed (intercepted by `UserPromptSubmit` hook). Names stored in `.state.json` keyed by session ID — multiple tabs in the same repo each get independent names. `/peon-ping-rename` with no argument resets to auto-detect.
- **`CLAUDE_SESSION_NAME` env var** — set before launching `claude` to give a session a fixed name at the environment level. Shows in both notification titles and terminal tab titles.
- **`notification_title_script` config key** — shell command run at event time to compute the project name dynamically. Receives `PEON_SESSION_ID`, `PEON_CWD`, `PEON_HOOK_EVENT`, `PEON_SESSION_NAME` env vars; stdout used as project name (max 50 chars).
- **Updated priority chain**: `/peon-ping-rename` > `CLAUDE_SESSION_NAME` > `.peon-label` > `notification_title_script` > `project_name_map` > `notification_title_override` > git repo name > folder name.

### Fixed
- `.peon-label` tier now correctly guarded with `if not project:` — was previously overwriting higher-priority tiers.

## v2.12.1 (2026-03-02)

### Fixed
- **mac-overlay cleanup** — orphaned `mac-overlay.js` osascript processes are now killed on `SessionEnd`, preventing stale overlay popups after Claude Code exits (#299, #301)
- **Adapter cooldown bug** — `amp.sh` and `antigravity.sh` no longer prematurely mark threads idle during the Stop cooldown window, fixing dropped Stop events for rapid task completions (#300)

## v2.12.0 (2026-02-27)

### Added
- **Windows PowerShell adapters** — native `.ps1` adapters for all 11 IDEs (codex, gemini, copilot, windsurf, kiro, openclaw, amp, antigravity, kimi, opencode, kilo). No Git Bash or WSL required. Filesystem watchers use .NET `FileSystemWatcher`. 198 Pester tests added. (#285)

### Fixed
- **OpenCode subagent noise** — filter subagent sessions from sound/notification events. Subagent sessions (spawned by Task tool with `parentID`) no longer trigger sounds for `session.idle`, `session.error`, and `session.status` events. (#290, fixes #289)


## v2.11.0 (2026-02-26)

### Added
- **Kimi Code adapter** — filesystem watcher for [Kimi Code CLI](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli) (MoonshotAI). Watches `~/.kimi/sessions/` for session events and translates them to CESP format. Uses the same `fswatch`/`inotifywait` pattern as the Amp and Antigravity adapters. Includes BATS tests.

## v2.10.1 (2026-02-25)

### Fixed
- Fix Ghostty terminal detection when running inside tmux: `_mac_terminal_bundle_id()` now falls back to env vars (`GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR`, `ITERM_SESSION_ID`, `WARP_IS_LOCAL_SHELL_SESSION`) when `TERM_PROGRAM` is overwritten by tmux/screen (#269)
- Fix case-sensitive Ghostty process name in `terminal_is_focused()`: add lowercase `ghostty` match alongside `Ghostty` (#269)

## v2.10.0 (2026-02-23)

### Added
- **Amp adapter** — filesystem watcher for [Amp](https://ampcode.com) (Sourcegraph). Watches `~/.local/share/amp/threads/` for thread JSON file changes. Detects `SessionStart` (new thread) and `Stop` (agent finished turn, waiting for input) by inspecting the last message in the thread JSON. Uses the same `fswatch`/`inotifywait` + idle timer pattern as the Antigravity adapter, with an additional `thread_is_waiting()` check to confirm the agent isn't mid-tool-execution. Includes 17 BATS tests.

## v2.9.0 (2026-02-21)

### Added
- **MSYS2 / Git Bash platform support** — `install.sh`, `peon.sh`, and `scripts/notify.sh` now detect `MSYS_NT-*` / `MINGW*` uname strings as `"msys2"` platform. Audio plays via native players (`ffplay`, `mpv`, `play`) with PowerShell `win-play.ps1` fallback. Desktop notifications use Windows toast (standard) or Windows Forms overlay, with `cygpath -w` for path conversion.

## v2.8.0 (2026-02-20)

### Fixed
- **Cursor on Windows**: peon.ps1 now maps Cursor's camelCase event names (`sessionStart`, `stop`, etc.) to PascalCase, fixing no-sounds-on-new-chat when using Third-party skills
- **Cursor on Windows**: `install.ps1` and `uninstall.ps1` now handle Cursor's flat-array `hooks.json` format (matching `install.sh` fix from v2.7.x)
- peon.ps1 pack rotation: accept `session_override` alias in addition to `agentskill`

### Added
- Click-to-focus for IDE embedded terminals (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Zed) — when `TERM_PROGRAM` doesn't map to a standalone terminal, falls back to deriving the IDE's bundle ID from its PID via `lsappinfo` (macOS built-in)
- PID-based `NSRunningApplication` activation in `mac-overlay.js` as belt-and-suspenders fallback when bundle ID lookup fails

## v2.7.0 (2026-02-19)

### Added
- `path_rules` config array: glob-pattern-based CWD-to-pack assignment (layer 3 in override hierarchy)
- Click-to-focus terminal on macOS notification click — overlay style detects terminal via `TERM_PROGRAM` → bundle ID mapping (Ghostty, Warp, iTerm2, Terminal.app); standard style uses `terminal-notifier` with `-activate`
- IDE PID detection (`_mac_ide_pid()`) for Cursor/Windsurf/Zed/VS Code ancestor click-to-focus

### Changed
- `active_pack` → `default_pack` (backward-compat fallback + `peon update` migration)
- `agentskill` rotation mode → `session_override` (`agentskill` accepted as alias)
- Override hierarchy (high→low): `session_override` > local project config > `path_rules` > `pack_rotation` > `default_pack`

# Changelog

## v2.6.0 (2026-02-19)

### Added
- `suppress_subagent_complete` config option (default: `false`) — when enabled, suppresses `task.complete` sounds and notifications for sub-agent sessions spawned via Claude Code's Task tool, so only the parent session's completion sound fires

## v2.5.0 (2026-02-18)

### Added
- `cwd` field in `last_active` state (`.state.json`) — records the working directory of each hook invocation, enabling [peon-pet](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-pet) to display the project folder name in session dot tooltips

## v2.4.1 (2026-02-18)

### Fixed
- Pack rotation: `session_packs` entries in dict format (after cleanup upgrade) were not recognized by the `in pack_rotation` check, causing a new random pack to be picked on every non-SessionStart event — same session could play sounds from different characters each turn
- `SubagentStart` now exits silently after saving state — previously could play `task.acknowledge` sound on the parent session
- Task-spawned subagent sessions now inherit the parent session's voice pack via `pending_subagent_pack` state, ensuring a single conversation always uses one character

## v2.4.0 (2026-02-18)

### Added
- Project-local config override: place a `config.json` at `.claude/hooks/peon-ping/config.json` in any project to override the global config for that project only

### Fixed
- `hook-handle-use.sh`: macOS BSD sed does not support `\s`/`\S` — replaced with POSIX `[[:space:]]`/`[^[:space:]]` classes (closes #212)
- OpenCode plugin: `desktop_notifications: false` in config was ignored — AppleScript notifications now respect the setting (closes #207)
- OpenCode plugin: Linux audio backend chain now matches `peon.sh` priority order (`pw-play` → `paplay` → `aplay`) with correct per-backend volume scaling

## v2.3.0 (2026-02-18)

### Added
- `peon volume [0.0-1.0]` CLI command — get or set volume from the terminal
- `peon rotation [random|round-robin|agentskill]` CLI command — get or set pack rotation mode from the terminal

### Fixed
- macOS overlay (`mac-overlay.js`) is now correctly copied during install — previously only `.sh`/`.ps1`/`.swift` scripts were copied, so the visual overlay banner never appeared
- Resume sessions (`source: "resume"`) preserve the active voice pack instead of picking a new random one

### Changed
- Default pack set reduced to 5 curated WC/SC/Portal packs: `peon`, `peasant`, `sc_kerrigan`, `sc_battlecruiser`, `glados`

## v2.2.3 (2026-02-18)

### Changed
- `UserPromptSubmit` removed from default registered hooks — peon no longer fires on every user message. The `/peon-ping-use` skill hook remains registered under `UserPromptSubmit`. Re-add manually to `~/.claude/settings.json` if you want the annoyed easter egg or `task.acknowledge`.
- `task.acknowledge` default changed to `false` in `config.json` template (was `true`, which caused a sound on every message even without the hook firing explicitly)

This also mitigates the Windows console raw mode issue (#205) where spawning `powershell.exe` on every `UserPromptSubmit` corrupted Claude Code's keyboard input.

## v2.2.2 (2026-02-18)

### Fixed
- `peon-play` and `mac-overlay.js` now resolve correctly on Homebrew/adapter installs where `$PEON_DIR` is remapped (same root cause as the `pack-download.sh` issue fixed in v2.2.1)
- Overlay notifications fall through to standard notifications when `mac-overlay.js` is not found rather than silently failing
- `USE_SOUND_EFFECTS_DEVICE` unbound variable crash in `play_sound` when called from preview context

## v2.2.1 (2026-02-18)

### Fixed
- `peon packs install`, `peon packs use --install`, and `peon packs list --registry` now correctly locate `pack-download.sh` on Homebrew and adapter installs where `$PEON_DIR` is remapped away from the script directory ([#204](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/204))
- Test isolation: `PEON_TEST=1` now exported globally in test setup so all `run bash peon.sh` calls correctly skip the Homebrew path probe

## v2.2.0 (2026-02-17)

### Added
- MCP server (`mcp/`) for agent-driven sound playback via Model Context Protocol
- OpenClaw adapter documented in README and llms.txt
- `SubagentStart` and `PostToolUseFailure` now registered in installer hook list
- `task.error` and `task.acknowledge` added to "What you'll hear" README table
- `/peon-ping-use` and `/peon-ping-log` skills documented in CLAUDE.md and llms.txt

### Fixed
- MCP server: `pw-play` volume now uses correct 0.0–1.0 float scale (was 0–65536)
- MCP server: reads volume from `config.json` instead of requiring `PEON_VOLUME` env var
- `openclaw.sh`: error events now map to `PostToolUseFailure` (task.error) not `Stop`
- `peon help`: added missing `mobile on/pushover/telegram` and `relay --bind` entries
- Windows installer: `PostToolUseFailure` and `SubagentStart` now registered and handled

### Changed
- Pack count updated to 75+ across all docs
- Hero copy updated to "any AI agent" framing with MCP server mention

## v2.1.1 (2026-02-17)

### Security
- Pass WSL Windows Forms notification message via temp file to prevent PowerShell script injection ([#187](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/187))

### Added
- macOS JXA Cocoa overlay notifications with configurable `overlay`/`standard` styles and `peon notifications` CLI ([#185](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/185))
- CESP §5.5 icon resolution chain for pack-aware notifications (sound → category → pack → icon.png → default) with path traversal protection ([#189](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/189))

### Fixed
- Background relay health check on SessionStart to avoid blocking greeting sound for SSH/devcontainer users ([#190](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/190))
- OpenCode adapter `task.complete` debounce increased to 5s to prevent repeated notifications in plan mode ([#188](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/188))

## v2.1.0 (2026-02-17)

### Added
- `peon packs install <pack1,pack2>` and `peon packs install --all` for post-install pack management ([#179](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/179))
- `peon packs list --registry` to browse all available packs from the registry ([#179](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/179))
- Bash and fish shell completions for new packs commands ([#179](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/pull/179))
